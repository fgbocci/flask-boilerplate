# flask-boilerplate

Example of how a simple CRUD could be implemented using flask with an extensible and clean project structure.

Most of the examples that I found on the internet were too _toyish_ , having this example would have helped me when I was starting.  

### Disclaimers

#### Productive usage

This example is **not** production ready. You should add and application server like Gunicorn or uWSGI in order to do so.

#### Tests

There are only basic interface tests. Unit tests should be added to any core component.
